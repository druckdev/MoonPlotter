# MoonPlotter
A small app which scrapes a persons logbook data from the moonboard website and provides some interesting graphs.


**Setup :**
Install geckodriver (driver for firefox) 

Using the aur (which threw a bunch of 404s for me):
`á»³ay -S aur/geckodriver-hg`

Using pip:
`pip install get-gecko-driver`

And if necessary Selenium.
`pip3 install selenium`
